            <h2> Difference between authorization and authentication :</h2>
            <p>Authentication is the process of verifying something or someone whether they are real or not. It could be a person, data, application, document, or anything. Authorization deals with the right of accessibility where it defines the right of someone or something. It tells whether a person or something can access, use or modify something else. In a computerized system, authentication confirms users are who they say they are, and authorization gives the user permission to access a resource.</p>
